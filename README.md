# DeepQNlearning_cartpolecontrols
The classic Cartpole balancing problem attempted via OpenAI Gym. Chaotic organization. But my PC couldn't handle all files through one single env, so had to juggle between them. Apologies in advance. I'll do me best to reply ASAP to any doubts you could have.

I highly take reference from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO5g5qLrLSo&t=522s. The same implementation style with change in a few policy parameters.
